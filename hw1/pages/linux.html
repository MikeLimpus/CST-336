                Linux is an open-source monolithic kernel developed by Linus Torvalds in 1991 as an open-source
                kernel alternative to other proprietery kernels. This kernel, when combined with the free and open source
                GNU userland, is called GNU/Linux. <sub>[1]</sub> Unlike Windows and MacOS, which are developed and released
                by a single entity, GNU/Linux is developed by many groups and released as distributions, commonly called
                "distros" by the community<sub>[2]</sub>. Some of these distros are created by companies, such as Ubuntu and Red Hat. 
                Others are community, volunteer projects like Arch Linux and Debian. Many distros exist because they fit certain 
                needs of different types of users. For example, Red Hat is offered as a paid service for companies who need on-demand 
                tech support. <sub>[3]</sub>
